PH has a workforce at the moment of this analysis of 240,124 employees, but we have realized that there is a massive amount of employees that are eligible for retiring,
althought not everyone will retire at the same time the company has set up immediatly an organized replacement plan for all those areas that might be affected in case a "Silver Tsunami" becomes present 
and avoid that the company might have problems filling up all those vacancies.

were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955, were hired between January 1, 1985 and December 31, 1988 and are currently working in the company.
